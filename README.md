This application tracks car-killed animals across the state of Wisconsin. 
This application has two main purposes: to identify car-killed animals for pick-up and to gather data to study animal-roadway interactions.
Users can add information on known car-killed animal locations, and users can see points added by other users. 
This map features a layer of Wisconsin county boundaries. I was going to add in major and county roadways, but it ended up being too busy and messy. 
Basemap contains major roadways and county roads.
